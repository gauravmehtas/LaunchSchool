Bugs are errors made my humans while coding, debugging is the process of identifying and fixing those erros.

Process of debugging code

1. identifying / locate the problem => what is causing the problem, method invocation, variable assignment, variable scope. checking stack trace

2. understand the problem => what is causing the problem

3. Implementing a solution

TYPES OF ERROS

SYNTAX ERRORS - the code does not conform to the grammer of the programming language, stops code for functioning

LOGICAL ERROS - erros in the logic of the code, which creates unexpected results. code will run but result is not right. These are harder to debug.

Pry IS REPL  => READ-EVALUATE-PRINT LOOP 

  TAKES USER INPUT
  EVALUATE THE INPUT
  RETURN RESULT TO THE USER
  LOOPS BACK TO START 

Pry vs irb

pry has color coding syntax
more options to work with
implement methods directly to the object
